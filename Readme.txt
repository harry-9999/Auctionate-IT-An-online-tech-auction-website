* Project was done by two teammates hence we implemented two (and a little more) parts from the checklist.
* Admin and customer service accounts are provided however they serve no real purpose since we did not do those parts as explained
* The default user for mysql DB connection is set to root and password is blank. This can be changed to fit your SQL database in the file "Project_group71\src\main\java\com\cs336\dbapp\ApplicationDB.java"
